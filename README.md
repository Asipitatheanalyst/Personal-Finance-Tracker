## PERSONAL FINANCE TRACKER OVERVIEW

This project presents a comprehensive financial tracking dashboard created in Microsoft Excel. It consolidates *Income, **Expenses, and **Savings* into a single interactive report that helps users visualize their financial activity over time. The dashboard is structured to support data-driven decisions and personal finance monitoring.

---
## DATA SOURCE

This project uses three datasets sourced externally:

- *Income Dataset*: Contains various income streams such as salary, freelance, business, side hustle, and bonuses.
- *Expenses Dataset*: Records spending across categories like food, healthcare, utilities, entertainment, etc.
- *Savings Dataset*: Tracks savings across categories like emergency funds, investments, and retirement.

All datasets are time-stamped and categorized to support time-series and categorical analysis.

## TOOLS

- *Microsoft Excel*
- *Power Pivot (Data Model)*
- *Pivot Tables & Charts*
- *Slicers & Timelines*
- *Conditional Formatting*
- *DAX (basic usage in calculated fields)*

## DATA PROCESSING

1. *Data Cleaning*: Ensured consistent formatting of date fields and category labels.
2. *Support Table Creation*: Built a unified reference table for Category and Date values to ensure compatibility across all three datasets.
3. *Data Modeling*: Used Excel’s Data Model (Power Pivot) to create relationships between datasets and support tables.
4. *Measure Calculations*: Calculated KPIs like total income, expenses, savings, and rates using pivot tables and calculated fields.
5. *Interactive Elements*: Added slicers (for year, category type, category name) and timelines to filter and explore data dynamically.

## INSIGHTS

- The *Company income source* is the highest contributor at $345,465.
- *Cash payments* were the most common method for receiving income.
- *Food and Rent* are the most significant expense categories.
- A high *savings rate of 83%* indicates strong financial discipline or high income.
- The largest savings chunk is allocated to *Emergency Funds* followed by *Investments*.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

- Consider diversifying income sources further to reduce reliance on a single stream.
- Monitor expense categories like Food and Rent more closely to optimize costs.
- Evaluate savings allocations periodically to align with long-term goals (e.g., increase retirement contributions).
- Transition more payments to traceable digital methods for improved financial records.
- Continue tracking over time to observe changes and spot financial growth opportunities.
